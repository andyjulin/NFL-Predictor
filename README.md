## NFL Predictor

This is a project which attempts to utilize machine learning in order to predict the winners of weekly NFL matchups.  The idea is to use the weekly stats of each team (Total Points, Passing Yards, Rushing Rank, etc.) in a predictive manner for Victory.  It is also serving as a framework while I investigate learning and practicing with other ML models.
