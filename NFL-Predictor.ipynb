    "## NFL Matchup Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "I started this project to try and predict the winners of NFL games each week.  It definitely didn't have anything to do with me making terrible predictions in Fantasy, and was only about practicing Machine Learning.... Yes, that's it...\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, the idea is to predict the outcome of a given game using weekly stats of the team from previous games that year.  These include things like Total Yards, QB Rating, Rushing Rank, Points Allowed, ..., etc.  With this, each matchup represents a row of data giving us 256 total games per season (~16 games a week for ~16 weeks) over a spread of around 10 years.  That is, I am treating each team-week-year as a data point with features given by the values of the weekly stats.  Given these data, the goal is to train a predictive model to determine a correlation of each team in the matchup with Victory.  My assumption is the higher value should be the Winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: since Week 1 has no previous weeks in that season, this setup does not make predictions until Week 2.  It's possible I could use Week 17 of the previous season as a proxy, but I don't think the correlation between years is strong enough to warrant that (sounds like another future project to explore!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial code follows below, though the work has so far been about constructing a valid pipeline; not much model tuning has been performed at this point.  Ideally, I plan to use this setup to learn more about neural networks, but that is not yet included.  For now it is using xgboost, as it is the prediction model I am most familiar with."

Most of it is fairly standard, although there were annoying things like dealing with 'JAX' transforming into 'JAC' briefly.  I am only taking data from 2002 on, as this is when the division realignment took place, putting the league into its current format.  "

From preliminary testing (not shown here), it seems the average over all previous weeks in the season is most effective, but that will need to be revisited once the model tuning begins.\n",

In the case of a BYE week, the `avg_previous_week` function will look one week further back, but the other functions will ignore this (which could result in averaging over only N - 1 weeks).  I may fix this in the future if the other averaging methods seem more potentially promising."

    "Currently, the success of the model is not amazing.  Given that every game is effectively a coin-flip, we are comparing to a baseline of 50% accuracy.  This means we are not strongly outperforming the default worst case.  However, it also turns out NFL games are hard to predict!  Even the best experts / algorithms are still rarely breaking about 70% accuracy.  It's possible the data are just too noisy to find meaningful correlations (also known as 'Any Given Sunday').  Still, this result of ~65% accuracy is reasonably solid given the minimal amount of testing / tuning currently undergone.  The predictions also seem to be improved as the season progresses, so it's possible there are fluctuations with low statistics that could be corrected in this process.  Further exploration and other models will be interesting to explore in order to see how much the predictions can be bolstered."
